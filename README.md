# Floppy

![Release](https://github.com/Wekaj/Floppy/workflows/Release/badge.svg)

A simple library intended to help speed up the creation of new MonoGame projects. Most of the tools are only useful for 2D games.

I mainly created this for my own Ludum Dare entries, so it isn't very robust or well-tested yet. If you were to use this in your own entry (which you are free to do so), I would recommend adding the Floppy project to your entry's solution so you can easily edit it to suite your needs.  

## Features

- Input bindings to the keyboard, the mouse and gamepads.
- Basic platformer physics.
- 2D camera and sprite animations.
- Pixel scaling.
- Screens.
